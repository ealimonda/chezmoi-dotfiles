#: `brew diff` [options] [<list.txt>]
#:
#: Shows the differences between the package list stored in <list.txt> and the
#: currently installed packages.
#:
#: The file <list.txt> is in the same format as printed by `brew leaves`.
#:
#: If <list.txt> is omitted, $HOME/.homebrew.txt will be used instead.
#:
#: Available options:
#: `-c`, `--color`: Output the diff with colors (if colordiff is installed).
