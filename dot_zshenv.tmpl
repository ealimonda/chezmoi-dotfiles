# Commands are first read from /etc/zshenv; this cannot be overridden.  Subsequent behaviour is modified by the RCS
# and GLOBAL_RCS options; the former affects all startup files, while the second only affects global startup files
# (those shown here with an path starting with a /).  If one of the options is unset at any point, any subsequent
# startup file(s) of the corresponding type will not be read.  It is also possible for a file in $ZDOTDIR to
# re-enable GLOBAL_RCS. Both RCS and GLOBAL_RCS are set by default.
#
# Commands are then read from $ZDOTDIR/.zshenv.  If the shell is a login shell, commands are read from /etc/zprofile
# and then $ZDOTDIR/.zprofile.  Then, if the shell is interactive, commands are read from /etc/zshrc and then
# $ZDOTDIR/.zshrc.  Finally, if the shell is a login shell, /etc/zlogin and $ZDOTDIR/.zlogin are read.
#
# When a login shell exits, the files $ZDOTDIR/.zlogout and then /etc/zlogout are read. This happens with either an
# explicit exit via the exit or logout commands, or an implicit exit by reading end-of-file from the terminal.
# However, if the shell terminates due to exec'ing another process, the logout files are not read.  These are also
# affected by the RCS and GLOBAL_RCS options.  Note also that the RCS option affects the saving of history files,
# i.e. if RCS is unset when the shell exits, no history file will be saved.
#
# If ZDOTDIR is unset, HOME is used instead.  Files listed above as being in /etc may be in another directory,
# depending on the installation.
#
# As /etc/zshenv is run for all instances of zsh, it is important that it be kept as small as possible.  In
# particular, it is a good idea to put code that does not need to be run for every single shell behind a test of the
# form `if [[ -o rcs ]]; then ...' so that it will not be executed when zsh is invoked with the `-f' option.
#
# Any of these files may be pre-compiled with the zcompile builtin command (see zshbuiltins(1)).  If a compiled file
# exists (named for the original file plus the .zwc extension) and it is newer than the original file, the compiled
# file will be used instead.
